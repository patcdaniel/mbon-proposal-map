### MBON Proposal Map ###

Maps and inserts were made using python and collecting data from a variety of sources:
	- Rockfish Cruise stations
	- Calcofi
	- Glider lines
	- Wind/Wave buoys
	- Seascapes
	- ATN tracks
	- HFR
	- Chl-a
	- SST
	- eDNA - ships, LRAUV tracks, point sample

Not all of the data made it into the final cut, but it is either available through ERDDAP or in the Data directory of this project.

Maps were stiched together Adobe Illustrator, those files are attached, but images references may need to be updated if they are broken.
